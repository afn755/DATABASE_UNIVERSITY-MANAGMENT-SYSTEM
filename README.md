<h1>University Management System Readme</h1>

Introduction:
The University Management System is designed to enhance academic delivery, streamline administrative processes, and improve overall efficiency for students, faculty, and the institution. This system offers various benefits, including time and resource savings, e-learning capabilities, an improved database, data backup options, self-service features, and enhanced communication within the university community.

Key Features:

Time, Money, and Resource Saving:

Efficiently manages student, teacher, and staff data, resulting in significant time and resource savings.

E-learning:

Provides a centralized platform for learning materials, including notes, results, notices, books, and instructions.

Improved Database:

Utilizes an efficient database system to manage all university data effectively.

Backup:

Enables data backup through cloud services, ensuring reliability.

Self-service:

Allows self-service operations such as enrollment, course selection, and registration, enhancing user experience.

Improved Communication:

Establishes a robust communication platform through the student-teacher portal hub.

Overview of the Management System:

Utilizes tables to store information about departments, faculty members, students, courses, classrooms, and faculty details.
Incorporates an ER Diagram to visualize relationships between different entities.
Implements normalization to ensure data integrity and eliminate redundancy.


Database Creation:

Includes tables for departments, faculty members, students, student courses, courses, classrooms, faculty details, and faculty courses.

Data Insertion:

Populates the tables with sample data to demonstrate the functionality of the system.


Query Examples:

Show all student details of the university.
Show all students from the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department.
Show all faculty members of the CSE department.
Show courses with not more than 3 credits.
Show all courses available in the university.
Display the class schedule of a faculty member.
Count the number of students in the university department-wise.
Show the highest-paid faculty member.
Show the class schedule of a specific faculty member.
Create a view and query the view.


Part B: Learning Experience:

Gained proficiency in SQL language, ER-Diagrams, table creation, data insertion, and normalization.
Encountered challenges during normalization, specifically in creating the "student_courses" table, leading to the modification of data types.
Acquired valuable skills in database design, normalization, and problem-solving.
Recognized the importance of creating advanced management systems for future projects.
